# It was scaffolded once, carries no generated marker, and `emit` will not write over it again --
# so your edits survive regeneration and the drift check does not police it.
#
# What it is for: exercising more of the schema than the minimal fixture does. The generator has
# filled in every writable attribute whose value it could derive; what it could not is listed
# inside the block, and filling those in is the point of the file being yours.
